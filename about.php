                <p> A vehicle service or tune-up is a series of maintenance procedures carried out at a set time interval or after the vehicle has traveled a certain distance. The service intervals are specified by the vehicle manufacturer in a service schedule and some modern cars display the due date for the next service electronically on the instrument panel. A tune-up should not be confused with engine tuning, which is the modifying of an engine to perform better than the original specification, rather than using maintenance to keep the engine running as it should.</p></br>
                <p> A vehicle service is when you take your vehicle to a garage for a routine check up. A mechanic will look at your vehicle’s condition and check parts for wear and tear, like brakes, oil, filters and engine belt. It’s common for the garage to replace your oil filter as part of the service. They may recommend that you replace other vehicle parts too. </p>
